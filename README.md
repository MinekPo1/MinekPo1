# About me

Hi! I am Lily: mainly a python developer, but I also have a bit of experience in C++ and JS.

I have created a few esoteric programing languages:

- [SaHuTOrEPoL](https://www.github.com/MinekPo1/SaHuTOrEPoL) (& implementation: [SaHuTOrEPoLPy](https://www.github.com/MinekPo1/SaHuTOrEPoLPy))
- [FuSS](https://www.github.com/MinekPo1/FuSS)

I am also working on data mining the mobile game "Hybrid Animals":

- [HAMerchant](https://www.github.com/MinekPo1/HAMerchant): a tool for analyzing merchant trades
- [HAsave-reader](https://www.github.com/walksanatora/HAsave-reader): a tool for reading, parsing and dumping save files
